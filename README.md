# I-Ching-RND <br>
<br>
I created a new Plugin called I_Ching_RND <br>
it's just an idea but it's tested and it works (and has his User Manual). <br>
Obviously this is only one of multiple ideas on how to use the I-Ching hexagrams <br>
for creating randomness in a modular system, in this case on the Disting-NT module.<br>
I think it has a lot of possibilities to generate a lot of randomness.<br>
It's partially inspired by the Qu-bit Chance module...<br>
